    <h1>Check out my borders</h1>
    <p>
    We've modified the content div to have a 1px darkgrey border with rounded corners of an 8px
    <br>
    radius.
    <br>
    Other elements can have borders too, <span class="red-border">like this span with the class red-border</span>.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
    You can change the color of horizontal rules by changing the border color;
    <br>
    all horizontal rules are now #CFDFE4.
    <br>
    Alternately, <span class="red-outline">this span has a red outline (red-outline class).</span>
    <br>
    That prevents it from messing with the line height.
    </p>
    </div>

    <p>
    Notice how the borders double up here:
    </p>
    <div class="red-border">
    This div has a red border</div>
    <div class="blue-border">
    This div has a blue border</div>
    <p>
    Notice how this fixes the borders:
    </p>
    <div class="red-border1">    
    This div has a red border, except on the bottom, and 8px round top corners</div>
    <div class="blue-border1">
    This div has a blue border, and 8px round bottom corners</div>
